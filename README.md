# Driving Change: A Data-Driven Strategy for Minimizing Diesel Bans

## Data Collection

For this project, I needed data from three different areas: Traffic, emissions and weather data. 

The city of Darmstadt provides access to its traffic data via a [platform](https://datenplattform.darmstadt.de/verkehr/apps/opendata/#/) for interested parties. These are minute-by-minute data for every intersection in the Darmstadt city area. With the amount of data needed, however, the use of the platform was very costly, so I thank the city of Darmstadt for exporting the data directly from the traffic computer and making it available to me. Many thanks!

The weather data as well as the emission data are provided [here](https://www.hlnug.de/messwerte/datenportal/tabelle/t/1/14/4) by the Hessian Ministry.
